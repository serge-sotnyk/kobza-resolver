# Kobza resolver
Utilities for resolving the kobza-app: https://kobzaapp.github.io/

This game is an analog of the known English game Wordly:

For this game we have implemented the Wordle Solver:

The Kobza used the same principle but for the Ukrainian language. I didn't find 
the solver for this variant, so I implemented the helper myself. The vocabulary 
for the game was found here:

After some experiments, the [pure-HTML version](kobza-solver.html) of this utility looks like the most 
useful.
